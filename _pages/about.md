I am a researcher in computational color with extensive teaching experience in many aspects of mathematics
and computer science. I have developed novel approaches to solve different problems ranging from color
constancy to color stabilization, color characterization, color gamut mapping, high dynamic range imaging,
image dehazing, image denoising, and vision color properties such as unique hue prediction and color naming.
I have published 31 articles in top-ranked journals (26 of them as either first or second author), including
IEEE-TPAMI, IEEE-TIP, PR, and SIAM-SIIMS. I have an European Patent granted -and a second application
in process-, and research experience in cutting-edge research labs in Spain, UK, Canda, and Switzerland, working
in high-profile research projects. I have extensive experience in teaching in both undergraduate and master
courses in Spain and the UK, with more of 1000 hours of teaching already performed.
